I decided to make my jockey class an interface for the strategy pattern behind the horse racing. The instructions
mentioned that each jockey has his/her own style so I thought I would make that evident in my design. The three classes
that implemented this class were EarlySprint, SlowStart, and SteadyRun. These all implemented the function run(). Based
off of whatever the style of the jockey was, run() would execute accordingly. I also chose to use an interface because
I wanted each different style of jockey to implement their own strategy. For the actual racing, I had my race class which
controlled the flow of the race. I also had a horse class that represented each horse. Each horse had it's own jockey
strategy, among other things such as name and position (position was how many miles into the 10 mile track the horse it).
The main loop for the racing is in the race class in the runRace() function. The horses are stored in an array list and
runRace() goes through that loop and updates their position until someone hits the 10 mile marker. I decided to use an
array list so that I could add as many horses as I wanted without placing a cap on them. I also had the race loop in the
Race class because that class is supposed to control the race flow.
