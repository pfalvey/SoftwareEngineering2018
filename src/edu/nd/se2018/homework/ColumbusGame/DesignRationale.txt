I overall was very happy with my design. Per usual, having good object oriented design and using classes
makes my design a lot easier to work with. In terms of the actual observer pattern, I really liked this new
pattern. I had never used it before so it was good to implement it. What I liked about it is that it abstracts
away a layer of monitoring/time keeping (per say). I think that in the past, before knowing about this pattern,
I would've probably had a clock and would've checked if the position of Columbus' ship changed before moving the
pirate ships. With the observer pattern and it's update function, I don't have to worry about that specific of 
coordination. Simply whenever Columbus' ship changes, it let's the pirates know so that they automatically chase him.
JavaFX was also fairly straightforward to use which made this design work as well.

In order to reset the board, I would probably just clear the board and start from scratch like what I do in my code
here. I first populate the islands like in the OceanMap constructor, then I add the water. I then would generate new
random positions for Columbus' ship and for the two pirate ships and change it using their setShipPosition method.
In order to have the island tiles and water tiles be photos of actual islands/water, I would create new image objects for
the water and the islands. So a new Images and ImageViews. So instead of coloring the tile blue or green, I just add
in a new Image/ImageView to its position.
